  ' this smartwatch was invented by  Rama Tobbo,a 20-year-old girl from Lebanon. She wanted to create a device that blends technology and style while providing useful features for daily life. If you have any questions about this device, feel free to ask!',
  "this smartwatch uses a combination of sensors to provide accurate measurements 1\n.Heart Rate Monitoring: It features a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor that detects blood flow in the wrist. By shining a light onto the skin and measuring how much light is absorbed, the device can calculate heart rate in real-time.Oxygen Level Measurement: For measuring oxygen saturation, it employs a similar PPG method. It analyzes the light absorption at different wavelengths to determine the percentage of oxygen in the blood.Weather Pressure and Temperature: The smartwatch is equipped with a barometric pressure sensor that detects changes in atmospheric pressure, which can be used to predict weather changes. For temperature, it includes a temperature sensor that measures the surrounding environment.All this data is processed through the smartwatch's internal software, which provides users with real-time readings and insights about their health and environment.",
